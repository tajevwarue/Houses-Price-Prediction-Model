# House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains the code and data for predicting house prices using the `kc_house` dataset. The model is built using a stacking ensemble of five different regression models.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column Name        | Data Type   |
|--------------------|-------------|
| id                 | int64       |
| date               | object      |
| price              | float64     |
| bedrooms           | int64       |
| bathrooms          | float64     |
| sqft_living        | int64       |
| sqft_lot           | int64       |
| floors             | float64     |
| waterfront         | int64       |
| view               | int64       |
| condition          | int64       |
| grade              | int64       |
| sqft_above         | int64       |
| sqft_basement      | int64       |
| yr_built           | int64       |
| yr_renovated       | int64       |
| zipcode            | int64       |
| lat                | float64     |
| long               | float64     |
| sqft_living15      | int64       |
| sqft_lot15         | int64       |

## Data Preprocessing

- **Missing Values**: Missing values in `sqft_above` were filled using the median, as its distribution was skewed to the right.
- **Encoding**: `zipcode` was encoded using binary encoding.
- **Feature Engineering**: Distance from the center of the city was calculated using the `geopy` library.

## Model

The final model is a stacking ensemble of the following regressors:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - `max_depth=29`
   - `max_features=None`
   - `n_estimators=281`
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor**
   - `n_neighbors=4`
   - `p=1`
   - `weights='distance'`
4. **CatBoost Regressor**
5. **Neural Networks (MLPRegressor)**
   - `max_iter=1000`
   - `random_state=101`

The final estimator in the stacking ensemble is an **Extra Trees Regressor** with the following hyperparameters:
- `max_depth=27`
- `max_features=None`
- `min_samples_split=5`
- `n_estimators=628`

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using **Optuna**.

## Model Performance

The model's performance on the test set is as follows:

- **RÂ² Score**: 0.8721
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 69,022.46
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 14,764,289,913.48
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 121,508.39
